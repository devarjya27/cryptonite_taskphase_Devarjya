# Redirecting Output
In this challenge we need to redirect the string "PWN" into a file named COLLEGE using the `>` command. We do this by simply typing `echo PWN > COLLEGE` in the terminal.
```bash
hacker@piping~redirecting-output:~$ echo PWN > COLLEGE
Correct! You successfully redirected 'PWN' to the file 'COLLEGE'! Here is your 
flag:
pwn.college{QntA477tQkX5rLYoj0F5kfg8bBV.dRjN1QDLxITN0czW}
