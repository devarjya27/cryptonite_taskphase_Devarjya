# grepping for a needle in a haystack

In this challenge we are asked to use the `grep` command, which helps us find a particular string in a particullar file. It is required to search for `pwn.college` in the file `data.txt` whose path is `/challenge/data.txt`.

```bash

hacker@commands~grepping-for-a-needle-in-a-haystack:~$ grep pwn.college /challenge/data.txt
pwn.college{EuMOlvhRKYls4Aj7QVydHDSh7tg.ddTM4QDLxITN0czW}
