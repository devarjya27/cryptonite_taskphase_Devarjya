# touching files

In this challenge, we are asked to make use of the `touch` commmand. `touch` creates new empty files. We are creating two files 'pwn' and 'college' by executing `/tmp/pwn` and `/tmp/college`.

```bash
hacker@commands~touching-files:~$ touch /tmp/pwn
hacker@commands~touching-files:~$ touch /tmp/college
hacker@commands~touching-files:~$ /challenge/run
Success! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{4Ghl519d_HAwfovMehcHFXdOEB9.dBzM4QDLxITN0czW}
