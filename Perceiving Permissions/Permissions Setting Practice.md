# Permissions Setting Practice

In this challenge we need to make use of the `chmod` command but this time we are overwriting previous permissions and setting new ones using `=`.

# My Solve
Firstly we invoked `/challenge/run` to start the challenge after which i just followed the instructions and solved the 8 rounds. After that i set the permissions for `/flag` to everyone can read which gave us the required flag.
```bash
hacker@permissions~permissions-setting-practice:~$ /challenge/run

You've solved all 8 rounds! I have changed the ownership
of the /flag file so that you can 'chmod' it. You won't be able to read
it until you make it readable with chmod!

Current permissions of "/flag": ---------
- the user doesn't have read permissions
- the user doesn't have write permissions
- the user doesn't have execute permissions
- the group doesn't have read permissions
- the group doesn't have write permissions
- the group doesn't have execute permissions
- the world doesn't have read permissions
- the world doesn't have write permissions
- the world doesn't have execute permissions
hacker@permissions~permissions-setting-practice:~$ chmod u=r,g=r,o=r /flag
hacker@permissions~permissions-setting-practice:~$ cat /flag
