# Reading Files 
In this challenge we are asked to `read` files into variables. We need to read the output of `/challenge/read_me` into the variable `PWN` we can do that by `read PWN < /challenge/read_me`.

# My Solve
```bash
hacker@variables~reading-files:~$ read PWN < /challenge/read_me
You've set the PWN variable properly! As promised, here is the flag:
pwn.college{sLTbpwp6cSKm_jigKMudzEQEcat.dBjM4QDLxITN0czW}
