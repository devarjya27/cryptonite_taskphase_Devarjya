# Printing Variables
In this challenge we are asked to get the flag which is stored in a variable called `FLAG`. We need to have our shell print it out and we can do that using the `echo` command and prepending the variable name with `$`.

# My Solve
```bash
hacker@variables~printing-variables:~$ echo $FLAG
