# Reading Input
In this challenge, we need to use the `read` command to take input from the user. The `-p` argument helps us specify a prompt to make the user's task easier. We need to take input as `COLLEGE` for the variable `PWN`. We can do so by doing `read -p "Input: " PWN` or by simply doing `read PWN`.

# My Solve
```bash
hacker@variables~reading-input:~$ read -p "Input: " PWN
Input: COLLEGE
You've set the PWN variable properly! As promised, here is the flag:
pwn.college{4-sdq5q2d2sbGWjhPjBmZi3sx_6.dhzN1QDLxITN0czW}
