# Setting Variables
In this challenge we are asked to assign the value `COLLEGE` to the variable `PWN`. We can do that using `=`. We also need to be careful about not using `$` in front of the variable as `$` triggers variable expansion which we do not want in this case.

# My Solve
```bash
hacker@variables~setting-variables:~$ PWN=COLLEGE
You've set the PWN variable properly! As promised, here is the flag:
pwn.college{w6VZ30X2YioCD70nUiWeeosdWR9.dlTN1QDLxITN0czW}
