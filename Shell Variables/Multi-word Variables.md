# Multi-word Variables
In this challenge we assign a multi word value, `COLLEGE YEAH` to the variable `PWN` we can do that by putting `COLLEGE YEAH` under double quotes as having spaces doesnt work when we are setting a variable.

# My Solve
```bash
hacker@variables~multi-word-variables:~$ PWN="COLLEGE YEAH"
You've set the PWN variable properly! As promised, here is the flag:
pwn.college{sCSqB_0BzwN1KmmQkdz_KGgSgGZ.dBjN1QDLxITN0czW}
