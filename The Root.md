# The Root
The challenge gives a brief introduction about filepaths. It says that a filepath starts with `/`. 
We can invoke a program by providing its filepath in the terminal window.
We are asked to invoke a program pwn which has a file path of `/pwn`. The challenge also says that the first directory in the filepath is referred to as the root directory.
When the file path starts with the root directory, it is referred to as the absolute path.

```bash
hacker@paths~the-root:~$ /pwn
BOOM!!!
Here is your flag:
pwn.college{E2WjqWAq6o1xMUMWSpiY7X8_jDl.dhzN5QDLxITN0czW}
