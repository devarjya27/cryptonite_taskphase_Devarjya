# Matching with []
In this challenge we do the same thing we've been doing for the past 2 challenges but now instead of using `*` or `?`, we use `[]`. `[]` is a placeholder for a single character just like `?` but matches with only the characters we provide within the square brackets. As per the challenge we provide `bash` within the brackets to get fulffill the challenge.
```bash
hacker@globbing~matching-with-:~$ cd /challenge/files
hacker@globbing~matching-with-:/challenge/files$ /challenge/run file_[bash]
