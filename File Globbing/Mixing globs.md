# Mixing globs
In this challenge we need to use globbing to match with `challenging`, `pwning` and `educational` files. 
A not-so-fun fact: It took me more than 40 mins trying all sorts of permutations of letters inside `[]` only to find out that i need to put in the starting letters. ðŸ¤¡
```bash
hacker@globbing~mixing-globs:/challenge/files$ /challenge/run [ecp]*
You got it! Here is your flag!
